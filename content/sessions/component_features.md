Adjusting Component traits at runtime without using base classes or decorators? Ivy makes it happen: Ivy introduces a new concept called component features - small mixins for components, applied internally by Angular to all components. Furthermore, with Ivy you will be able to lazy load components on runtime without even using Angular modules anymore. During this talk you will get into the development with Ivy and all the benefits using component features instead of decorators.
