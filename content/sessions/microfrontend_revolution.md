The implementation of microfrontends has so far been anything but easy. Since common frameworks and build tools didn't even know this idea, you had to dig into the bag of tricks.
Module Federation offered by Webpack 5 initiates a crucial change of direction here. It allows you to load separately compiled applications at runtime and to share libraries between them.
In this session you will learn how you can use this mechanism to create microfrontends with Angular. In addition to the happy day scenarios, we also discuss pitfalls and approaches to avoid them. Furthermore, we take a look at possible alternatives.
At the end of the session you have an overview of the topic and know how you can use Module Federation in your projects and what the consequences are.
