You will always see a smile on Shmuela’s face, but if you want to add some extra glow in her eyes talk to her about Angular, community, or her little ngBaby. (ngToddler, actually, already!) She works as a Cloud Developer Advocate at Microsoft, where she gets to connect with the web community around Azure products and tools and contribute to related open source projects. As a Google Developer Expert, she teaches, consults and speaks about Web and Angular all around the world. Shmuela is the founder of ngGirls – an initiative aiming to increase diversity in the software development industry. BTW ngVikings is hosting, as always, an ngGirls workshop!
